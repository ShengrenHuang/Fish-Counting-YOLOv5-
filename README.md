# Fish-Counting-YOLOv5-

In this practice, we aim to employ the well-known object detection algorithm --- Yolo v5 [1] to engage the fish counting problem. By referring to [2], we first implement transfer learning along with a pre-trained model (Yolov5s) and the database of marine creatures [3]. With the help of the trained model and Yolov5, we are able to count the number of fish present in the video. The result is shown in the following video.
